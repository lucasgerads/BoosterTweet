### Twitter Bot on Covid19 Boosters in Germany

This bot pulls numbers from the official Robert Koch Institut (RKI)  website and publishes them on Twitter and the @BoosterDEU handle. 

The RKI publishes an Excel file each day with updated vaccination numbers. This script downloads the excel file, parses the numbers and then formats a tweet and then publishes the tweet on twitter.
